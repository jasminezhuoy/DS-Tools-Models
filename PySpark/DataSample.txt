I could try it on our 8 bit screens but I don't know how to render pixels with X in constant time. I recall our double buffer has other image color and one b&w -- that doesn't help either. Maybe I should dump photos to screen with low level code; how?  A few years ago a friend and I took some 256 grey-level photos from a 1 bit Mac Plus screen using this method. Displaying all 256 levels synchronized to the 60Hz display took about 10 seconds. After experimenting with different aperture settings and screen brightnesses we found a range that worked well, giving respectable contrast. The quality of the images was pretty good. There were no visible contrast bands.  To minimize the exposure time the display program built 255 different 1 bit frames. The first contained a dot only for pixels that had value 255, the second only for pixels that had value 254, etc. These frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was very fast to 'or' onto the screen in sequence. Creating these frames sometimes took 5-10 minutes on that old Mac, but the camera shutter was closed during that time anyway. And yes, we wrote directly to the screen memory. Mea culpa.  Our biggest problem was that small images were displayed in the top left corner of the screen instead of the center. It took an extra week to have the film developed and printed, because the processors took the trouble to manually move the all images into the center of the print.

This algorithm works well for me:  Algorithm to attempt to find outward-facing normals:  First, mark all faces as UNKNOWN.  Then create an edge dictionary that allows you to find all of the faces sharing a given edge (where an edge is two integers representing the two shared vertices).  Pick an arbitrary face and mark it COUNTER_CLOCKWISE.  Using the edge dictionary, orient all surrounding faces based on the orientation of this face.  And recurse for all surrounding faces, consistently orienting the entire surface.  Find the average of the vertices in this surface.  Using that point, calculate a volume measurement, taking into account the face's orientation.  If the volume turns out to be positive, assume the faces are oriented correctly.  If it is negative, reverse their orientations mark them CLOCKWISE).  If any faces are still UNKNOWN after this, choose another face and go through the algorithm again.  At the end, faces marked CLOCKWISE must have their indices reversed before facet normals are found.  Note: if you are running on Silicon Graphics machines and buy the IRIS Inventor 3D toolkit developers package you have the source to this algorithm-- see /usr/src/Inventor/tools/ivnorm/.

There are certain things about the way the plate tektoniks and volcanic activity effect a land scape that is, while not entirely random, unpredictable.  This is also true with fractals, so one could also conclude that you could model this fractally.   Yeah, and it's also true most long complicated sequences of events, calculations, or big computer programs in general.  I don't argue that you can get similar and maybe useful results from fractals, I just question whether you >should<.  The fractal fiends seem to be saying that any part of a system that we can't model should be replaced with a random number generator.  That has been useful, for instance, in making data more palatable to human perception or for torture testing the rest of the system, but I don't think it has much to do with fractals, and I certainly would rather that the model be improved in a more explicable manner.  I guess I just haven't seen all these earth-shaking fractal models that explain and correlate to the universe as it actually exists.  I really hope I do, but I'm not holding my self-similar breath.  There is one other thing that fractals are good for:  fractal image compression.  Uh huh.  I'll believe it when I see it.  I've been chasing fractal compression for a few years, and I still don't believe in it.  If it's so great, how come we don't see it competing with JPEG?  'Cause it can't, I'll wager.  Actually, I have wagered, I quit trying to make fractal compression work- and I was trying- because I don't think it's a reasonable alternative to other techniques.  It is neat, though. :-)  I'll reiterate my disbelief that everything is fractal.  That's why I don't think fractal compression as it is widely explained is practical.  I know Barnsley and Sloan have some tricks up their sleeves that make their demos work, but I don't see anyone using it in a real product.

It is known that the display response of tubes is non-linear and is sometimes said to follow Gamma-Law. I am not certain if these non-linearities are "Gamma-corrected" before encoding NTSC signals or if the TV display is supposed to correct this.  Also, if  256 grey levels, for example, are coded in a C program do these intensity levels appear with linear brightness on a PC monitor? In other words does PC monitor display circuitry correct for "gamma errrors"?  Your response is much appreciated.  Amjad.

Here is a short description and some technical information, taken from the accompanying documentation:   DMPEG V1.0  Public Domain MPEG decoder  by Stefan Eckart   Features   DMPEG/DMPLAY is another MPEG decoder/player for the PC:   decodes (nearly) the full MPEG video standard I,P,B frames, frame size up to at least 352x240 supported)  saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display  optional on-screen display during decoding (requires VGA)  several dithering options: ordered dither, Floyd-Steinberg, grayscale  color-space selection  runs under DOS, 640KB RAM, no MS-Windows required  very compact (small code / small data models, 16 bit arithmetic)  real time display of the raw file by a separate player for VGA and many Super-VGAs    Technical information   The player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1]. The IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2] not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zero coefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT sounds great, doesn't it?), which turned out to be faster than a 'fast' algorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Main difference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supported algorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option to use a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation dominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality of the dithered image (I claim, judge yourself).  Restricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributed over this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space points is thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at the expense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.  Saturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lying somewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximated by primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of constant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to the lower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than to hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improve on NTSC). The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redish areas.     Stefan Eckart, stefan@lis.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de </doc>

Note the early use of PostScript technology, predating many of this year's papers listed in the April 1st SIGGRAPH Program Announcement posted here a few days ago.  Eric   Intersection Between a Line and a Polygon (UNDECIDABLE??), by Dave Baraff, Tom Duff  From: deb@charisma.graphics.cornell.edu Newsgroups: comp.graphics Keywords: P, NP, Jordan curve separation, Ursyhon Metrization Theorem Organization: Program of Computer Graphics  In article [...] ncsmith@ndsuvax.UUCP (Timothy Lyle Smith) writes:  I need to find a formula/algorithm to determine if a line intersects a polygon.  I would prefer a method that would do this in as little time as possible.  I need this for use in a forward raytracing program.  I think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and polygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of points.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.  First, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the Jordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into exactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies completely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon, or possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.  Now, the phrasing of this question says "if a line intersects a polygon", so this is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is to reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to solve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.  In recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a new language called PostScript.  (See "PostScript Language", by Adobe Systems Incorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).  So, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that draws the line L and the polygon P, and then "outputs" the answer.  By output", we mean the program executes a command called "showpage", which actually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick examination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus the original problem.  There are two small problems with this approach.   There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the reduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of Choice (or equivalently, Zorn's Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of Choice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.  More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the PostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in other words, will it halt?  Now, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a Turing Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is undecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn out to be undecidable.   I won't even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite precision and running out of ink, paper or both.  A couple of references might be:  Principia Mathematica.  Newton, I.

The situation is not nearly as bleak as Baraff suggests (he should know better, he's hung around The Labs for long enough).  By the well known Dobbin-Dullman reduction (see J. Dullman & D. Dobbin, J. Comp. Obfusc. ii:  pp. 33-947, lemma 17) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to Hamiltonian Circuit, without the use of Grobner bases, so LPI (to coin an acronym) is probably only NP-complete.  Besides, Turing-completeness will no longer be a problem once our Cray-3 is delivered, since it will be able to complete an infinite loop in 4 milliseconds (with scatter-gather.)    From: deb@svax.cs.cornell.edu (David Baraff)  Well, sure its no worse than NP-complete, but that's ONLY if you restrict yourself to the case where the line satisfies a Lipschitz condition on its second derivative.

Does anyone have any such code or a reference to book containing information on the subject ?  Regards  Simon  Basically, there are two algorithms determining whether a point is inside, outside or on the polygon. The first one is Ray (or half line) method. In this method, you can draw any ray, if the number of the intersection point of the ray and the polygon is even, then it is outside. If the number is odd, then it is inside. Of cause, you have to deal with the special cases which may make you headache.  The second method is PI algorithm. Draw the lines between the point and all the vertices on the polygon. Calculate and sum the angles of the successive lines. If the result is 2*PI, then it is inside. If PI, then it is on the polygon. Otherwise it is outside.  My experience tells the second method is relible.  Hope this helps.  Yeh USC </doc>

Our agency started to express interest in virtual reality.  So far, we do not know much about VR.  All we know about are the Hollywood movies "The Terminater 2" and "Lawnmover Man".  We also know something about VR from ABC news magazine and Computer Graphics World magazine.   Unfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects for both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer graphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each frame of computer animation for those films took hours to render on high-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics would be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames per second).    We certainly want to know more about VR.  Who are the leading companies, agencies, universities?  What machines support VR (i.e. SGI, Sun4, HP-9000, BIM-6000, etc.)?   It depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is. True immersive visualization , requires the rendering of complex visual databases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This is a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot training. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of the frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion of the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system must be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex data representations.  Additionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15 frames per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps due to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was visible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the graphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant frame rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general does not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the UNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time operation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes.  Uniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time operation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not even SGI's uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our multiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due to their Symmetric Multi-Processing  shared-memory architecture.  From a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments requires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time multi-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems on the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2 systems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly important, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an unfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.   What kind of graphics languages are used with VR GL, opengl, Phigs, PEX, GKS, etc.)?  You can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop VR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level. There are off-the- shelf software packages available to get you going much faster, being targeted directly at the VR application developer. Some of the most popular are (in no particular order):  Division Inc.		    (Redwood City, CA) - dVS Sens8 Inc.		    (Sausalito, CA)    - WorldToolKit Naval Postgraduate School (Monterey, CA)     - NPSnet (FREE!) Gemini Technology Corp    (Irvine, CA)       - GVS Simation Series Paradigm Simulation Inc.  (Dallas, TX)       - VisionWorks, AudioWorks Silicon Graphics Inc.	    (Mountain View,CA) - IRIS Performer  There are some others, but not off the top of my head...   What companies are making interface devices for VR (goggles or BOOM (Binocular Omni-Orientational Monitor), hamlets, gloves, arms, etc.)?  There are too many to list here, but here is a smattering:  Fake Space Labs	    (Menlo Park,CA)    - BOOM Virtual Technologies Inc. (Stanford, CA)     - CyberGlove Digital Image Design	    (New York, NY)     - The Cricket (3D input) Kaiser Electro Optics	    (Carlsbad, CA)     - Sim Eye Helmet Displays Virtual Research	    (Sunnyvale, CA)    - Flight Helmet display Virtual Reality Inc.	    (Pleasantville,NY) - Head Mtd Displays, s/w Software Systems	    (San Jose, CA)     - 3D Modeling software etc., etc., etc.   What are those company's addresses and phone numbers?  Where we can get a list name of VR experts and their phone numbers and Email addresses?

(See "PostScript Language", by Adobe Systems Incorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).  So, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that draws the line L and the polygon P, and then "outputs" the answer.  By output", we mean the program executes a command called "showpage", which actually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick examination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and   thus the original problem.  Curiously, in modern PostScript, the point in a polygon problem can be solved even more easily.

Date: 14 Apr 1993 21:12:07 GMT Lines: 187 Distribution: world  Hi everyone,  I thought that some people may be interested in my VR software on these groups:  Announcing the release of Multiverse-1.0.2*******  Multiverse is a multi-user, non-immersive, X-Windows based Virtual Reality system, primarily focused on entertainment/research.  Features:  Client-Server based model, using Berkeley Sockets. No limit to the number of users (apart from performance). Generic clients. Customizable servers. Hierachical Objects (allowing attachment of cameras and light sources). Multiple light sources (ambient, point and spot). Objects can have extension code, to handle unique functionality, easily attached.  Functionality:  Client: The client is built around a 'fast' render loop. Basically it changes things when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to other users.  The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.  This release of the client software supports the following functionality:  o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)  o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)  o User Interface Panels  o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for faster frame rates)  o Mouse and Keyboard Input  Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)  Server: This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is provided in this release for potential world server developers:  o Transparent Client Management  o Client Message Handling  This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of accepting and terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the application writer can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.  Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:  o Server Selectable Extension Installation: What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension initialisers you want.  o Event Handler Registration: When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback functions for the events that you want the object to respond to. Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)  o Collision Detection Registration: If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide some basic information to the collision detection management software. Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.  This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects from which to choose.  The following is all you need to make a World Server application:  o Provide an initWorld function: This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus any initialization you want to do.  o Provide a positionObject function: This is where you determine where to place a new client.  o Provide an installWorldObjects function: This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.  o Provide a getWorldType function: This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.  o Provide an animateWorld function: This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit to avoid outrunning the clients).  That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the three world servers I've provided:  generic - 81 lines dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the stairs! Will probably be improved with future versions) dogfight - 72 lines  Location:  This software is located at the following site: ftp.u.washington.edu  Directory: pub/virtual-worlds  File: multiverse-1.0.2.tar.Z  Futures:  Client:  o Texture mapping.  o More realistic rendering: i.e. Z-Buffering (or similar), Gouraud shading  o HMD support.  o Etc, etc....  Server:  o Physical Modelling (gravity, friction etc).  o Enhanced Object Management/Interaction  o Etc, etc....  Both:  o Improved Comms!!!  I hope this provides people with a good understanding of the Multiverse software, unfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation, and I'm not sure whether that will ever be able to be rectified! :-(  I hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of the Virtual Universe - I've certainly found fascinating developing it, and I would *LOVE* to add support for the PowerGlove...and an HMD :-)!!  Finally one major disclaimer:  This is totally amateur code. By that I mean there is no support for this code other than what I, out the kindness of my heart, or you, out of pure desperation, provide. I cannot be held responsible for anything good or bad that may happen through the use of this code - USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!  Disclaimer over!  Of course if you love it, I would like to here from you. And anyone with POSITIVE contributions/criticisms is also encouraged to contact me. Anyone who hates it: > /dev/null!    And if anyone wants to let me do this for a living: you know where to write :-)!    Thanks,  Robert.  robert@acsc.com  </doc>

Lee) writes: The original posting complained  about SGI coming out with newer (and better) architectures and not having an upgrade path from the older ones, and  that DEC did.  No.  That's *not* what I was complaining about, nor did I intend to suggest that DEC was any better than SGI (let me tell you about the Lynx some day, but be prepared with a large sedative if you do...).  My comment regarding DEC was to indicate that I might be open to other vendors that supported OpenGL, rather than deal further with SGI.  What I *am* annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that we *would* be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the Crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck.  I'm also annoyed about being sold *several* Personal IRISes at a previous site on the understanding *that* architecture would be around for a while, rather than being flushed.  Now I understand that SGI is responsible to its investors and has to keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line (odd that I found myself pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books just before the end of the quarter), but I'm just a little tired of getting boned in the process.  Maybe it's because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies, so we aren't entitled to a "peek under the covers" as the Big Kids (NASA, for instance) are.  This lab, and I suspect that a lot of other labs and organizations, doesn't have a load of money to spend on computers every year, so we can't be out buying new systems on a regular basis. The boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the entire grant period of five years and, in some case, beyond.  That means that I need to buy the best piece of equipment that I can when I have the money, not some product that was built, to paraphrase one previous poster's words, 'to fill a niche' to compete with some other vendor.  I'm going to be looking at this box for the next five years. And every time I look at it, I'm going to think about SGI and how I could have better spent my money (actually *your* money, since we're supported almost entirely by Federal tax dollars).  Now you'll have to pardon me while I go off and hiss and fume in a corner somewhere and think dark, libelous thoughts.  spl  Steve Lamont, SciViGuy --  534-7968 -- spl@szechuan.ucsd.edu San Diego Microscopy and Imaging Resource/UC San Diego/La Jolla, CA 92093-0608 My other car is a car, too."

Version 1.21 is mainly a bugfix for THINK C users. THIS VERSION NOW RUNS WITH THINK C, I PROMISE! The Docs now contain a chapter for C programmers on how to use the GrafSys. If you have problems, feel free  to contact me. The other change is that I removed the FastPerfTrig calls from the FPU version to make it run faster.  Those of you who don't know what all this is about, read on.    Programmers 3D GrafSys -- What it is:   Didn't you always have this great game in mind where you needed some way of  drawing three-dimensional scenes?   Didn't you always want to write this program that visualized the structure  of three-dimensional molecules?  And didn't the task of writing your 3D conversions routines keep you from  actually doing it?  Well if the answer to any of the above questions is 'Yes, but what has it to  do with this package???' , read on.  GrafSys is a THINK Pascal/C library that provides you with simple routines  for building, saving, loading (as resources), and manipulating  independent rotating around arbitrary achses, translating and scaling)  three dimensional objects. Objects, not just simple single-line drawings.  GrafSys supports full 3D clipping, animation and some (primitive) hidden- line/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM.  GrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel projections (If you can't understand a word, don't worry, this is just showing off for those who know about it. The docs that come with it will try to explain what it all means later on).   GrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with data so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routines to do the actual drawing. (Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines so you don't have to worry about that if you don't want to)  GrafSys 1.11 comes in two versions. One for the 881 and 020 or above  processors. The other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any Mac. Both versions are *100% source compatibel*.   GrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3D graphics and how to use the package.  If demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object-class library.  However, I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for a lot more people than the select 'OOP-Guild'.  GrafSys is free for any non-commercial usage.

Weber) Subject: Need help with Mitsubishi P78U image printer Date: 15 Apr 1993 09:37:39 -0700 Lines: 26 Distribution: na  Our group recently bought a Mitsubishi P78U video printer and I could use some help with it.  We bought this thing because it  has a parallel data input in addition to the usual video signal inputs and  claimed to print 256 gray level images.  However, the manual that came with it only describes how to format the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images.  After some initial problems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a parallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images just fine.  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video signal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.  However they did say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, but they didn't have any information about how to program it to do so, and they would call Japan, etc.  Frankly, I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel images from the video source, it can't store 8 bits/pixel in the memory.  It's not like memory is that expensive any more.  If anybody has any information on getting 6 bit/pixel (or even 8 bit/pixel) images out of this thing, I would greatly appreciate your sending it to me.  Thanks.

Date: 15 Apr 93 18:20:46 GMT Lines: 123  My comment regarding DEC was to indicate that I might be open to other vendors that supported OpenGL, rather than deal further with SGI.  OpenGL is a graphics programming library and as such is a great, portable interface for the development of interactive 3D graphics applications. It is not, however, an indicator of performance, as that will vary strongly from machine to machine and vendor to vendor.  SGI is committed to high performance interactive graphics systems and software tools, so OpenGL means that you can port easily from SGI to other platforms, there is no guarantee that your performance would be comparable.   What I *am* annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that we *would* be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the Crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck.  If your sales representative truly mislead you, then you should have a valid grievance against us which you should carry up to your local SGI sales management team. Feel free to contact the local branch manager...we understand that repeat sales come from satisfied customers, so give it a shot.   I'm also annoyed about being sold *several* Personal IRISes at a previous site on the understanding *that* architecture would be around for a while, rather than being flushed.  As one of the previous posts stated, the Personal IRIS was introduced in and grew to include the 4D/20, 4D/25, 4D/30 and 4D/35 as clock rates sped up over time. As a rule of thumb, SGI platforms live for about 4-5 years. This was true of the motorola-based 3000 series ('85-'89), the PI the Professional Series (the early 4D's - '86-'90), the Power Series parallel systems ('88-'93). Individual CPU subsystems running at a particular clock rate usually live for about 2 years. New graphics architectures at the high end (GT, VGX, RealityEngine) are released every months to 2 years.  These are the facts of life.  If we look at these machines, they become almost archaic after four years, and we have to come out with a new platform (like Indigo, Onyx, Challenge) which has higher bus bandwidths, faster CPUs, faster graphics and I/O, and larger disk capacities. If we don't, we become uncompetitive.  From the user perspective, you have to buy a machine that meets your current needs and makes economic sense today.  You can't wait to buy, but if you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine, ask the Sales Rep for one in writing. If it's feasible, they should be able to do that. Some of our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them, such as the Performance Protection Program for older R3000-based Power Series multiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtain a guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new Onyx or Challenge R4400-based 64-bit multiprocessor systems.   Now I understand that SGI is responsible to its investors and has to keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line (odd that I found myself pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books just before the end of the quarter), but I'm just a little tired of getting boned in the process.   If that's happening, it's becausing of misunderstandings or mis-communication, not because SGI is directly attempting to annoy our customer base.  Maybe it's because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies, so we aren't entitled to a "peek under the covers" as the Big Kids (NASA, for instance) are.  This lab, and I suspect that a lot of other labs and organizations, doesn't have a load of money to spend on computers every year, so we can't be out buying new systems on a regular basis.  Most SGI customers are onesy-twosey types, but regardless, we rarely give a great deal of notice when we are about to introduce a new system because again, like a previous post stated, if we pre-announced and the schedule slipped, we would mess up our potential customers schedules (when they were counting on the availability of the new systems on a particular date) and would also look awfully bad to both our investors and the financial analysts who watch us most carefully to see if we are meeting our commitments.  The boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the entire grant period of five years and, in some case, beyond. That means that I need to buy the best piece of equipment that I can when I have the money, not some product that was built, to paraphrase one previous poster's words, 'to fill a niche' to compete with some other vendor.  I'm going to be looking at this box for the next five years. And every time I look at it, I'm going to think about SGI and how I could have better spent my money (actually *your* money, since we're supported almost entirely by Federal tax dollars).   Five years is an awfully long time in computer years. New processor technologies are arriving every 1-2 years, making a 5 year old computer at least 2 and probably 3 generations behind the times. The competitive nature of the market is demanding that rate of development, so if your timing is really 5 years between purchases, you have to accept the limited viability of whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor.  There are some realities about the computer biz that we all have to live with, but keeping customers happy is the most important, so don't give up, we know it.

The long answer is yes - but a few have had a few problems with their platforms - not all unix's are the same, you know! As far as "many bugs" go, it would probably be more useful to everyone (including you) if you were a bit more explicit! :-)  Platforms it has succesfully compiled and run on are: RS6000, Dec Ultrix Sun Solaris so it is possible.  The main problem is that I don't have access to other platforms than the RS6000, so if there are portability problems then the only way I hear about them is by people letting me know and giving me a clue as to how to fix it.  As far as the software not doing anything, do you really think I would bother releasing it, if that was the case? Perhaps you didn't read the few docs that ARE supplied. The dogfight world is made up of clients only, so if you're in there on your own, then you're not going to see anything! The dactyl world has quite a lot of scenary - so if you don't see anything there, then this is definitely a problem!  One final word - if you're not interested, don't bother with it. If you are interested, then please remember that I'm not asking for any money! So why not try a little patience and constructive criticism, maybe that will get results??

I originally wrote the routines as a kind of exercise for myself, but perhaps someone here will find them useful.  They are certainly useable as they are, but are missing some higher-level functionality.  They're intended more as an intro to mode 13h programming, a starting point.  The library assumes a 386 processor, but it is trivial to modify it for a 286.  If enough people ask, I'll make the mods and re-post it as a different version.  The routines are written in assembly (TASM) and are callable from C.  They are fairly simple, but I've found them to be very fast (for my purposes, anyway).  Routines are included to enter and exit mode 13h, define a virtual screen", put and get pixels, put a pixmap (rectangular image with no transparent spots), put a sprite (image with see-thru areas), copy areas of the virtual screen into video memory, etc.  I've also included a simple C routine to draw a line, as well as a C routine to load a 256 color GIF image into a buffer.  I also wrote a quick'n'dirty demo program that bounces a bunch of sprites around behind three "windows".  The whole package is available on spang.camosun.bc.ca in /pub/dos/vgl.zip  It is zipped with pkzip 2.04g  It is completely in the public domain, as far as I'm concerned.  Do with it whatever you like.  However, it'd be nice to get credit where it's due, and maybe an e-mail telling me you like it (if you don't like it don't bother)  Mark morley@camosun.bc.ca </doc>

It's not a bad question: I don't have any refs that list this algorithm either. But thinking about it a bit, it shouldn't be too hard.  Take three of the points and find the plane they define as well as the circle that they lie on (you say you have this algorithm already)  Find the center  of this circle. The line passing through this center perpendicular to the plane of the three points passes through the center of the sphere.  Repeat with the unused point and two of the original points. This gives you two different lines that both pass through the sphere's origin. Their interection is the center of the sphere.  the radius is easy to compute, it's just the distance from the center to any of the original points.  I'll leave the math to you, but this is a workable algorithm. :-)   An alternate method would be to take pairs of points: the plane formed by the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains the center of the sphere. Three pairs will form three planes, intersecting at a point. This might be easier to implement.  Steve spworley@netcom.com </doc>

Possibly you punched in the wrong numbers on your calculator.  256 color modes take a byte per pixel so 640 time 480 is which is 300k to be exact.  640x400x256 only takes 250k but I don't think it is a BIOS mode.  I wouldn't bet that all VGA cards can do that either.  If a VGA card has 512k I bet it can do both 640x400 and x480.  That by definition is SVGA, though not very high SVGA.   Yes, I did punch in the wrong numbers (working too many late nites).  I intended on stating 640x400 is 256,000 bytes.  It's not in the bios, just my VESA TSR.

Since he isn't in the position to post this himself, he asked me to post it for him, but to leave his name out. So here it comes:  CView has quite a number of bugs.  The one you mention is perhaps the most annoying, but not the most dangerous.  As far as I can determine, it has to do with the temp files that CView creates.  CView gives the user no control over where it places its temp files: it just places them in its current directory".  The problem you mention occurs (as far as I can tell) when it runs out of disk space for its temp files. It seems as if CView doesn't check properly for this situation.  As Cview decodes a jpeg, it seems  to write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour information. Then, for 8 bit displays, it does the "dithering", again writing another file with the 8 bit colour information.  While it is writing this second file, it also writes the data to your colour card. Then when it does the last chunk of 8 bit data, it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file to your screen again.  (It does this last "recopy" operation for its fit to screen" feature, even when this feature is not enabled.)  The result of this process is the following:  If it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file, all you ever see is as much data as it has room for, and the last bit of data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes/reads aren't performed.  If it has enough room for the 24 bit data, but runs out of room for the 8 bit data, you see almost all of the picture as it does the dithering and writes to the screen card. However, then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data from the 8 bit file to screen (for whatever reason it does this) one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which there was room on the disk.  This is just a guess, but probably fairly accurate.  At least the general idea is on track I think, although I have probably made errors in details about file I/O etc.  The way around this is  of course to clear up sufficient disk space.  The temp files for large JPEG's (1200x900 and bigger) can be very large (3 Meg + 1 Meg ).  On some of the largest I have needed in excess of 6 Meg free disk space.   CView has a much more serious bug: if you are trying to display a file from a floppy, and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on the floppy, then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory (and FAT table? I can't remember) for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted floppy, thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious, possibly unrevcoverable way.  SO BE CAREFUL!  It is incredibly poor programming for a program to do this.  On the other hand, when choosing files in the Open Files menu, CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the hi-lighter square.  Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once when it gets the directory info.  And really, how much effort does it take to sort a directory listing?

If anyone has any suggestions/algorithms/bug-free ready to compile C code :)  that might help us, it would be much appreciated.  Thanks in advance,  Gregory </doc>

Date: 16 Apr 93 11:50:44 GMT Lines: 42  Hi to all out there.  We have this problem, and I'm not certain I'm solving it in the correct way.  I was wondering if anyone can shed light on this, or point me in the right place to look...  We have an X-ray imaging camera and a metallic tube with a cylindrical hole passing through it at a right angle to the tube's axis:   image  X-ray source ]                     ||                   | screen metallic || tube              |    We know source--screen centre distance, radius of the tube, radius of the hole.  We do some calculations based on the image of the hole on the screen.  However, the calculations are mathematically highly complex, and must assume that the object's hole projects an image (resembling an ellipse if the tube is not parallel to the screen) in the centre of the screen.  However, it is unlikely that the object is placed so conveniently.    Firstly, we must transform the major and minor axis of the ellipse.  I cannot know what the angle between the tube and screen is.  Do I have to assume that they are parallel to do the transformation?  How do I do this transformation?  Secondly, there is a distortion of the image due to the screen being planar the source--screen distance increases as we move away from the centre of the screen).  How can I compensate the ellipse's axis for this image distortion?  So, please can anyone give us a few pointers here?  How do we transform the image so it appears as it would if it were in the centre of the screen, and how do I deal with distortion due to the shape of the screen?  We'd appreciate any help, either posted or emailed.  Thanks in advance, Simon.  Simon Marshall, Dept. of Computer Science, University of Hull, Hull HU6 7RX, UK Football isn't about life and death.
